# battleship

This project is based of the traditional battleship game in which you have to destroy the opponet ship fleet before yours gets destroyed.
In this version of the game that I've made, instead of playing versus other humans (players), you will be against the computer.

You have the choice of placing your fleet however you like on the board, as long as you place it accordingly to the rules.
